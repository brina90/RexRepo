    <h2>SIZE GUIDLINE</h2>
    <p class="size"> At ROYAL SUITS we don't just sell suits, we make sure it fits. Our size guideline and consultation sections provide a direction like a compass to ensure that you wear the right suits with the right fit. The first impression your Suit will make on you is the fitting, before attention would be shifted on the designs and color. It doesn't matter how expensive the material of a Suit/cloth is, once the fitting is unappealing, it has failed on one of its primary purposes.
In Suits, the first impression is golden. Unlike your casual clothings, there are rules and etiquette to be observed. If you are looking for a more in-depth guide to Suit fit and etiquette, our blog offers deeper information on Suit etiquette.
Suit is arguably the most complex and important item in a man’s wardrobe, hence must be worn with the right size and fit.</p>
